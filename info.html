			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I was in Ireland over the summer, I learned a lot about Irish history, from prehistory to the 20th century. It was very interesting, but I was especially intrigued by the Vikings and their raids. My goal for this project was to learn more about Viking history, and then combine everything I learned on their history, culture, warfare into a comprehensive website to help explain the Vikings to others, as well as assess the continued legacy of the Vikings.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings, also known as Northmen and Varangians (especially by the Greeks/East Slavs), were Nordic seafarers from the European region of Scandinavia who raided and traded throughout most of northern, central, and eastern Europe during the late 8th to late 11th centuries, a period often known as the Viking Age. The term also has been extended to include the inhabitants of Viking home communities in Scandinavia. The military, mercantile, and demographic expansion of the Viking Age had a significant effect on the development of much of Europe.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seafaring Vikings were made up of land-owning chieftains, clan heads, their retainers, freemen, and anyone who sought adventure and riches overseas. While at home, most Vikings were independent, loosely organized independent farmers, at sea they were highly organized bands and armies of raiders and pillagers driven by leaders of ability. They navigated the coast of Europe, mounting raids on coastline cities, which earned them the name <i>vikingr</i>, meaning “pirate” in Old Norse.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viking activities, due to the aid of the longship, extended into the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. This exploration facilitated the development of  settlements stretching from European Russia to as far east as North America, where they frequently assimilated into the culture. This period of expansion allowed for the spread of Viking culture, and the introduction of foreign cultures into Scandinavian culture, as well as the Christianization of the pagan Vikings.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Popular conception of the Vikings is much different than what is presented by archaeology and historical sources. Contemporary representations often paint the Vikings as “noble savages”, and they are alternately portrayed as violent heathens and great adventurers. Current popular representations rely on clichés and stereotypes, greatly confusing the picture of the Vikings.</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Viking Age is usually defined from the early 790s to 1066, when the Normans, Viking descendants who controlled Normandy in northern France, invaded England. The period was defined by Viking exploration of Europe via seas and rivers for purposes of trading, raiding, colonizing, and conquering. The expansion may have been driven by retaliation against Christian missionaries for encroaching on tribal lands, or by overpopulation, changes in trade patterns and profitability, and the lack of viable farmland in their homeland. Information about the Viking Age is drawn mostly from archaeology, what was written about them by their enemies, and secondary sources like the Icelandic Sagas, prose narratives mostly recorded in the 14th and 15th centuries.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first recorded Viking raid was in 789, when a group of Norwegian men landed on the Isle of Portland, and, upon being mistaken as merchants, murdered a royal official. The beginning of the Viking Age in England, however, is dated to June 9, 793 when Vikings destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne, a center of learning on an island off of England’s northeast coast. The monks were killed, thrown in the sea, or taken away as slaves along with the abbey’s riches. Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York wrote of the raid, “Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared.” From that point on, the Vikings were regarded as “wolves among sheep”, and continued to raid abbeys and churches in the British Isles.</p>

			</div>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the western seas, the Viking expansion touched almost every possible point, from Iceland, to Greenland, to settlements as far west as North America. Settlements also sprung up in the Orkney, Faroe, and Shetland islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; France, under Charlemagne and his descendants, was also troubled by the Vikings. At the end of Charlemagne’s reign, the Vikings commenced a series of raids culminating in the conquest and settlement of Normandy. In 911, the French king Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking chief Rollo that gave him and his followers possession of Normandy in exchange for his fealty, conversion to Christianity, and their defense against other Viking groups. The Normans would later conquer both England, in 1066, and Ireland, in 1169.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings traveled along the river-valleys of Northern Europe, settling, trading, and raiding as they went. They also expanded east, eventually founding the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus’. Other Vikings continued south to the Black Sea to Constantinople, trading extensively with the Byzantines. 
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The trading, raiding, and settling of the Vikings touched mostly Scandinavia, England, the Slavic states, and the western coast of Europe, founding well established settlements in Iceland, Greenland, Great Britain, and Normandy. In addition, the eastern expansions of the Vikings allowed for the creation of Kievan Rus’ and the assimilation of the Vikings into Slavic culture. Central Europe, while mostly untouched by the Vikings due to powerful nations there. However, almost none of Europe was left unaffected by the Viking Age. From the Varangian Guard of the Byzantines to the settlement of England, Europe was forever changed by Viking influence. </p>

			</div>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the three centuries of the Viking Age, Scandinavian culture underwent drastic changes. Christianity had taken hold in the previously pagan region, and the Catholic Church had affirmed the establishment of monarchies in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The cause of Christianity spread quickly through Scandinavia, with the establishment of ecclesiastical administrative centers, dioceses, and archbishoprics. Old ideas and ideologies were changing.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christianity altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers, and how they viewed their neighbors. Much of the Viking raids had been focused on enslaving those who they conquered, but the Christian ban on chattel slavery disincentivized such activity, and raiding fell markedly. The Scandinavian peoples of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark would no longer be called Vikings.</p>

			<h2>Culture</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings were a mostly non-literate society– although they had Old Norse, they produced no literary legacy besides what was inscribed on runestones. As a result, much of what we know about the Vikings comes from countries who were in contact with them, and not the Vikings themselves. In recent years, the archaeological legacy of the Vikings has given us a more complete picture of their lives.</p>
			<h3>Everyday Life</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings were split into three socioeconomic classes: the Thralls, the Karls, and the Jarls. The Thralls were slaves, captured on raids or born to other Viking thralls. They were vital to the economy, and performed work from everyday jobs to large scale construction projects. They were generally looked down on and despised by the other Viking classes. The Karls were peasants. They owned farms, land, and cattle, and performed the tasks associated with this job, such as milking the cows and ploughing the fields. They employed thralls to help them with their work. The Jarls were Viking aristocracy. They owned lots of land, lived in large longhouses, and employed many thralls to care for their estates. The Jarls therefore had free time to engage in administration and politics, as well as hunting, sports, and expeditions.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women had exceptional power relative to other societies of the time. They could inherit property, become the head of a family, divorce and remarry, have children without being married, and attain religious authority. Unmarried women were considered full citizens, and women could become poets, rune masters, merchants, and medicine women. However, after the introduction of Christianity, many of these rights disappeared.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for fashion, the Jarls had expensive fashion taste. They were well groomed, unlike the stereotype, and wore expensive clothing and crafted jewelry in designs unique to the Vikings. The Karls had similar taste, but expressed it in a more relaxed, inexpensive way.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings had a diverse cuisine, with lots of different ingredients. They ate meat of all kinds and preparations, especially beef, mutton, pork, and occasionally horse meat. Cows, goats, and sheep were also used for their milk, which could be turned into buttermilk or cheese. Chickens were kept for their eggs and meat, and game birds were also consumed. Seafood was another important part of the Viking diet, consisting of whale, walrus, seal, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and various fish. They also consumed bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. The food was not always plentiful, however, and the quality of food was not terribly high. Alcoholic beverages such as beer, mead, and wine were frequently served.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sports were encouraged by the Vikings, especially those which helped hone and develop combat skills, including spear and stone throwing, wrestling, mountain-climbing, running, and swimming. The Vikings also skied and ice skated in the winter, and used skis to help them get around.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vikings also engaged in board games, with pieces made from stone, wood, or bone, and, in rarer situations, materials such as glass, amber, antler, and even ivory. The Vikings played several types of tafl games, which were strategic, war based games.</p>

					<p class="caption">A reconstruction of a tafl game board and its pieces.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Government</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viking governance took the form of a primitive democracy. Each kingdom was divided into districts, and in each district all free men met in an assembly called a “thing”. All the free men had equal vote in the proceedings, which covered political decisions, land disputes, and criminal trials. The assembly was guided by the impartial law-speaker. However, it worked out that those with more wealth and power had more of a say, and the thing had few formal procedures. If an agreement could not be reached in a dispute, duels or ordeals often resulted.</p>
			<h3>Religion and Mythology</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the 11th century, the Vikings were entirely pagan, without any sort of central church or organization, or any written traditions or stories. Therefore, the religion was highly personalized from region to region, and evolved significantly.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their gods, the Aesir and the Vanir, lived in Asgard, which was connected to Earth (Midgard) by the rainbow bridge called the Bifrost. Their gods included Odin, Thor, and Frejya, and other figures included dark elves, evil giants, and dwarves. Warriors who died in battle went to Valhalla, where they fought alongside Odin, died, feasted, and did it again the next day. The mythology also decreed a final battle between the gods and evil forces called Ragnarok, where the evil forces would win and the world would descend into chaos.</p>
			<h3>Language and Literature</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most important sources on the Vikings, ironically, are not in the vernacular language of Old Norse, but in Latin from Christian and Islamic communities outside of Scandinavia in which the Vikings were active. The Vikings did use runes, but usually only for short, formulaic inscriptions, usually on stone. Secondary sources written in the 12th through 14th centuries were written in vernacular Latin and Old Norse, the prime examples being the Icelandic Sagas, a series of medieval prose narratives about the Vikings, that, while not being a literal interpretation of actual events, give us insight into the skaldic writings of court poets, the family trees, the self images and the ethical values of the Vikings.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Norse could read and write using an alphabet called <i>runor</i>. Very little of this writing still exists on paper, but persists on engravings on stones called runestones. These runestones were often used to memorialize the dead, but were not necessarily graves. These stones attest to various Viking journeys, and give us glimpses into Viking expeditions.</p>

			<h3>Ships</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings were master shipbuilders. Isolated by mountains and water in Scandinavia, their easiest way of communication with the outside world was through the water. They built many kinds of ships, but the best known was the longship, a swift wooden ship that was able to travel through deep sea and shallow river alike. The longship was perfect for exploration and warfare, and provided oars as well as sails as means of propulsion.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The longships were clinker-built, with a length between 17.5 and 36 meters. They were steered by a rear oar on the starboard side rather than a rudder, could hold 25-60 men plus supplies, and could achieve speeds of 10 to 11 knots, and more in short bursts. Figureheads would often be placed at the stem and stern of the boat, underlied by rows of shields to indicate warlike intent.</p>

				<div class="captionbox">
					<img src="./img/longship.jpg">
					<p class="caption">A clinker-built longship. Notice how the boards overlap.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fleets were often small, and the ships rarely fought sea-battles, and when they did, they were close to shore. The Viking raiders would attempt to board and capture their enemies’ ships, and the warriors in the prow were specifically selected for this task.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The longship, and other ships built by the Vikings, were integral to their culture. They facilitated much of the Viking way of life, from everyday transportation to the raiding and trading the Vikings are known for. They also held a significant religious position, and many people of high status were buried in ships.</p>
			<h3>Burials</h3>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not all Vikings were buried in ships, however. Their burial practices were quite varied, and also included dug graves and tumuli. However, most Viking funerals took place at sea, and included burial or cremation (not in the way you’re thinking, however: the flaming arrows shot at a longship never happened– those things were expensive). The grave goods present in Viking burials give us insight on what was important to have in the afterlife, from thralls who were sacrificed to be buried with their master to a sword and riding gear.</p>

			<h2>Warfare</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our knowledge of Viking armor and weapons comes mostly from archaeological finds, pictures, and the recording of Norse laws in secondary sources. All Norse men were expected to own weapons, and magnates were expected to provide them. The main weapons were the spear, sword, and battleaxe– considered honorable meleé weapons. Bows and projectiles were also used. Weapons were also indicators of wealth– the more you had and the more intricately decorated, the wealthier you were.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spears were the main weapon, used for thrusting and throwing– skilled warriors could throw two at a time! Swords were more costly, making them a sign of status. They were often inscribed and named, and were usually around the length of a man’s arm. Long-handed battle axes were also used, but because they were two-handed, they prevented the use of a shield, so warriors yielding these would take cover behind the front line, then rush out and hew down the enemy.</p>
			<div class="outerbox">
				<div class="captionbox">
					<img src="./img/vikingswords.jpg">
					<p class="caption">Viking sword hilts.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For defense, warriors carried wooden circular shields, which were probably covered with leather. They wore leather tunics or reindeer hide, sometimes with a mail shirt on top by richer Vikings, usually the leading man. The richer Vikings also wore iron helmets, often with a iron or leather nosepiece to protect the face. One thing they certainly did not wear were horned helmets, which would have been impractical in battle.</p>
			<div class="outerbox">
				<div class="captionbox">
					<img src="./img/vikinghelmet.jpg">
					<p class="caption">Helmet from a chieftain's grave.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings had no professional standing army, and their battle techniques were relatively rudimentary, although the bonds between the men and their lord would have given the armies additional strength. Most warriors had been trained since youth to fight. Battle began by throwing a spear to dedicate them to Odin, followed by more projectiles. Then, each side would attempt to rout the opposition, or kill their leaders. This was often accomplished by charging in “boar formation”.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most interesting aspects of Viking warfare were the berserkers. These were warriors who would work themselves into a battle frenzy and ignore the pain of their wounds, therefore allowing them to wear no armor. They believed that Odin gave them superhuman strength and powers, and often wore bear or wolf pelts. The berserk-state may have been initiated through the consumption of hallucinogens or alcohol.</p>

			<h2>Trade</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Vikings established an extensive web of trade routes throughout the known world, facilitated by their longships. This economic empire significantly affected the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia. The Vikings set up trading towns explicitly to trade with their contacts in Europe and Asia. They had no coinage system, so their trade was primarily based on a bullion economy, with the most common metal being silver. This silver circulated in bars as well as in jewelry (traders often wore “hack silver” jewelry, where they could cut pieces off), and traders carried scales with them to measure weight and guarantee a precise system of trade. This system was used for both trade within and without the Viking world.</p>

			<h2>Legacy</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For 5 centuries, the Vikings were all but forgotten. They had graced the English language with words such as Thursday, heathen, and Hell, and had left scattered archaeological sites throughout Europe, but the rest of Europe had moved on from the Vikings and their perceived bloodthirsty ways.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the 16th and 17th centuries, however, articles began to be published contesting the anti-Viking image, showing the complexity of the Vikings. These articles began to attain readership in Britain. Victorian England embraced this new romanticized picture of the Vikings, and the values their stories carried. More research began to be done on the Vikings, and archaeologists began to dig up Britain’s Viking past while linguists analyzed the Viking influence in the English language. In the 19th century, the term “Viking” was coined for these invaders from the North. The Victorian fascination with the Vikings was known as the Viking revival, and their rebranding of Vikings as role models led to the stereotypical romanticized Vikings we still see today.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Victorian perceptions of the Viking Age were just the beginning of the research into the era, and our impression of it has changed since, although the romantic notions established during the period have continued to exist. The capacity of the Vikings for reassessment and cultural transformation helps it maintain it’s intrigue and mysticism. It has been 1200+ years since the first Viking raid, and we are still eager to explore the history of the old north, and make it our own.</p>
